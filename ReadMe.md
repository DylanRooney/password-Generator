# **Password Generator**

## **What did I do?**

In this homework I was told to create a password generator in javascript

I tried to follow from what we had learned within our first week.
I realised I would have to use Math.floor and Math.random to generate a completely random password.
I decided to have the use of upper, lower, numbers and special characters to be a prompt, as that was all that was needed.

## ***Challenges?***

while I had my code look sound and in theory/logic I was able to see it would work, but wasn't able to debug further.
Having to use a function to develop it, even though it doesn't seem hard to grasp really confused me. I plan to go back and review this later.

## ***Changes for the future?***

In the future I will be reviewing as well as double-checking to see why the Password generator didn't work.
